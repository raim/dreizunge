# Implementation plan — the PDF-focus larger plan

*Written at the `v80` cut, against `roadmap_v79.md` (shipped history), `roadmap_v80.md` (open
items), `INTERNALS.md` and the 35 standing rules. No code was written for this document. Every
claim about the current code below was checked in the tree at this cut; where I could not check
something, it says so.*

---

## 0. Read this first — four findings that change the plan before it starts

### 0.1 `bayesian_knowledge_tracing.md` ARRIVED — Track B is unblocked, but not where expected

The document is now in `build_history/`. It is sound, and its central choice is the right one:
**skills (knowledge components) are the BKT unit, not lessons or chapters**, with one canonical
skill shared across every story that exercises it (§7), and storyline/language/global progress as
*aggregations* rather than separate models (§5, §11, §12). That is the standard framing and it
avoids the usual mistake.

**But the blocking work is not the BKT.** The update rule is about ten lines of arithmetic and needs
no design. Four things stand between the document and a working implementation, and they were
checked against the tree at this cut:

**(a) THE EXISTING EVIDENCE CANNOT BE REPLAYED.** `learners.json` stores
`state.progress.learned["<target>|<source>"].vocab[word] = { source, seen, wrong }` — **aggregate
counters, not an ordered observation stream.** BKT is sequential: `P(L)` is updated per attempt, in
order, and "wrong early then right" (learning) is a different state from "right then wrong"
(decay). From `seen: 7, wrong: 0` neither can be recovered. So either BKT starts from zero evidence
going forward, or the existing counters seed `pMastery` crudely and the history is discarded. **The
document's §13 `observations` log is therefore not optional and not a later refinement — it is the
prerequisite**, and the sooner it starts recording the sooner BKT has anything to run on.

**(b) THE CURRENT KEY CONTRADICTS §7.** Evidence is bucketed by **language PAIR** (`it|de`, `en|de`),
so a learner meeting German from English and the same learner meeting German from Italian have
separate records today. §7 explicitly requires one canonical `de:vocab:gehen` regardless of route.
That is a schema migration, and the pair-keyed data cannot be merged without deciding whether
source language is a property of the *evidence* (probably yes) or of the *skill* (probably no).

**(c) SKILL TAGGING IS THE REAL COST, AND IT IS LANGUAGE KNOWLEDGE.** §3/§4 require every exercise to
name the skill it tests. Nothing emits that today. Worse, `de:wordform:gehen:present:1sg` cannot be
computed by the app from the string `gehe` — it needs lemmatisation and morphological analysis,
which INTERNALS §4 puts squarely in the model's tier. So skill IDs will be **model output**, and
**the document does not address canonicalisation**: the same skill will arrive as
`de:vocab:gehen`, `de:vocabulary:gehen`, `de:vocab:Gehen`, `de:vocab:gehen:infinitive` across
generations, and §7's "one canonical skill" quietly fails. **A registry with model-proposed IDs
resolved against existing entries is needed on day one**, not later. This is the single largest
piece of new machinery in the whole plan and it is invisible in the document.

**(d) THE MASTERY GATES COLLIDE WITH THE APP'S EXISTING PROGRESSION.** §5 redefines story progress as
"percentage of required skills with P(mastery) >= 0.70" and §6 makes chapter unlocking depend on
mastery thresholds. Dreizunge **already has** a progression system — `chapterComplete`,
`lessonCountsFor`/`countedLessons`, the `coverageTarget` pass mark with storyline/chapter override,
`_slProgressStats` — and it is the most heavily guarded surface in the codebase
(`probe_gates_v77.js`, the `unit-story-unlocked-*` family, `unit-fork-display` §6). **§5/§6 are a
REPLACEMENT of that, not an addition.** They are also a product decision, not a technical one: the
current pass mark is a teacher-set number the user has ruled on more than once.

**Consequence for ordering:** Track B's *instrumentation* can start early and independently; Track
B's *gates* should be last or never, and must not be assumed. See §8.

**One measurement to take before anything else**, because it decides whether BKT will discriminate
at all: across all of `learners.json` only **40 words have ever been answered wrong (3.0%)**. With
the document's suggested `pGuess = 0.20`, `pSlip = 0.10`, an observation stream that is 97% correct
drives `pMastery` to ceiling almost everywhere — so §6's thresholds would unlock everything
immediately and §5's percentage would read ~100% for every learner. **Check first whether `wrong`
counts FIRST attempts or only un-retried ones.** If exercises are retried until correct, the stream
is not independent, BKT's assumptions do not hold, and the fix is in the answer recording, not in
the model parameters.

### 0.2 I damaged `roadmap_v80.md` at the cut, and this plan lands on the damage

When I created `roadmap_v80.md` I carried the open block from line 611 of `roadmap_v79.md` onward.
**Two whole open sections sit BEFORE that line and were lost:**

- `# 0. THE PROGRESS-CARD REWORK (user, at the v76 cut)` — with sub-items `0d`…`0h`
- `# 0i. LESSON GENERATION REWORK (user, at the v76 cut) — BLOCKED on §1`

`roadmap_v80.md` contains zero references to `0d`, `0h`, `0i`, "PROGRESS-CARD REWORK" or "LESSON
GENERATION REWORK"; `roadmap_v79.md` contains four. This is my error, made in the last ten minutes
of the previous session, and it is not cosmetic: **those two sections are the direct ancestors of
this plan's "CLEAN-UP PROGRESS CARDS" and "NEW LESSON GENERATION CARD".**

**Prerequisite task, before any of the below: re-carry both sections into `roadmap_v80.md`, then
reconcile them against this plan item by item** — each old bullet is either (a) superseded by a new
one, (b) still open and unmentioned here, or (c) already shipped. A superseded item must be struck
with a pointer, not silently dropped; that is how `v77_p`'s preview-panel removal stayed
comprehensible three releases later. Budget half a session.

### 0.3 Two open items from session 34 are still unanswered and one is cheap

- **The duplicate storyline title** (`sl_182891979` / `sl_1041030875`, both `🧈🔥 Dough of the
  Ancients`, the only duplicate in 90) — each side's fork link names the storyline the learner is
  already in. An authoring call.
- **Single-chapter storylines read `1/1` and a 100% bar before anything is played** —
  `_slProgressStats` adds one for the in-progress chapter. This one is **inside the progress-card
  clean-up below** and should be folded into it rather than fixed separately (§C1).
- **`unit-story-unlocked-page` §6 does not discriminate under revert** (carried since `v77_p`). It
  needs no ruling and it is a guard that cannot fail, which is worse than no guard. **Do it first,
  before the big plan starts** — half a session, and it protects the surface the progress-card
  rework is about to churn.

### 0.4 One question in the plan is already answered

> *"are tokens used for QC recorded? if not they should be."*

**They are.** `server.js` calls `addTokenUsage(_liveTopic(), _lqTok, 'lesson_qc')` and
`addTokenUsage(tp, _sqTok, 'story_qc')`. Chapter-level QC folds into
`generationStats.totalPromptTokens/totalCompletionTokens` — the same fields initial generation
writes, so "total" means total — and both carry a per-type tally in `tokensByType`. What is **not**
there: the `/api/qc` route itself has no `addTokenUsage` call at its own level, so a bulk QC run
attributes to the chapters it touched and nowhere else. If you want a *run-level* number ("this QC
sweep cost X"), that is a small addition and it belongs with the QC card (§F3), not with plumbing.

---

## 1. The strategic read: this plan is three products, not one

The plan as written mixes work at incompatible scales. Sorting it that way is most of the planning
value, because the small items are being blocked by the big ones for no reason.

| Track | What it is | Scale | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — Ingest** | Image upload, vision extraction, chaptering, word map | **New subsystem**, weeks | **Nothing — no rulings left.** PDF text already works (§2.5) |
| **B — Pedagogy** | BKT, adaptive selection, tutor, recommendation, learning arcs | **New subsystem**, weeks | Design doc ARRIVED; B1 can start now, B7 needs a ruling |
| **C — Surface** | Progress cards, UI/settings card, generation card, QC card, LMGTFY | **Incremental**, 1–2 sessions each | Mostly nothing |
| **D — Lessons** | Mixed-lesson selection, cases/articles, generic lessons | **Incremental**, 1 session each | Language-knowledge ruling (§5) |
| **E — Export** | Printable exams and teaching material | **Small, self-contained** | Nothing |

**Recommended order: C → E → D → A → B.** (A moved cheaper after the §2 correction — image ingest needs no dependency at all — but it still follows C, because the ingest UI lands on surfaces C is about to rework.) Reasons, in order of weight:

1. **Track C is where every user complaint in this document actually is.** The screenshots are all
   surface. Shipping C makes the app better for the corpus that already exists.
2. **Track A changes the architecture** (§2) and should not be started while the surface is churning.
3. **Track B needs a corpus and a design document** that do not yet exist (§0.1). It also needs
   learner data, and the session-33 measurement is stark: across all of `learners.json` only **40
   words have ever been answered wrong** (574 with any record, 3.0%). **A BKT model fitted on that
   would be fitting noise.** BKT is the right long-term answer and the wrong next thing.
4. **Track E is small, has no dependencies, and is the only item with a clear non-digital user.**
   It is the best "spare half session" filler in the whole plan.

---

## 2. INGEST ARCHITECTURE — corrected after the user's challenge

**My first draft of this section was wrong for images, and the user was right.** It framed
everything around PDF extraction and let the PDF difficulty contaminate the PNG case, which has
almost none of it. Corrected, with what was checked:

### 2.1 What the code already does

The app talks to Ollama over **`/api/chat`** with `messages:[{role,content}]`, using Node's built-in
`http`/`https` (`qc-lessons.js:67`, and `server.js` carries the same shape). **Ollama's chat API
accepts `images:[<base64>]` on a message.** So sending a PNG to a vision model is *an extra field on
a request the app already makes* — no new transport, no new dependency, no `package.json`. The
"zero-dependency" property is not at risk for image ingest at all.

### 2.2 The model can do both jobs, and the protocol is documented

Checked against the Ollama library and the MiniCPM-V CookBook:

- **`minicpm-v4.6` exists** (Ollama library) — SigLIP2-400M + **Qwen3.5-0.8B**, edge-focused,
  explicitly benchmarked on **RefCOCO** (a referring-expression *grounding* benchmark) and OCRBench.
- **`minicpm-v4.5` exists** — 8B on Qwen3-8B, OpenCompass 77.2, *"leading performance on OCRBench"*
  and *"state-of-the-art performance for PDF document parsing"*.
- **Grounding has a documented protocol** (`MiniCPM-V-CookBook/inference/minicpm-v4_5_grounding.md`):
  ask `Please provide the bounding box coordinate of the region this sentence describes:
  <ref>NAME</ref>`; the model answers with `<box>x1 y1 x2 y2</box>`, **normalised to 0–1000**,
  converted by `x = bbox[0]/1000 * width`.

So: **text extraction and panel coordinates from one model, one call shape, zero dependencies.**
That is the user's proposal and it is sound.

**Model choice, revised:** the plan's original `minicpm-v:8b-2.6-q4_K_M` is superseded by **`v4.5`**,
which is the same size class and explicitly better at OCR and document parsing. **`v4.6` is NOT the
newer-and-better option for this job** — its LLM is 0.8B, built for phones; it is the right pick for
on-device, the wrong one for ingest quality. Confirm what is pulled with `ollama list`.

### 2.3 Cropping is a non-issue — three ways out, cheapest first

My draft implied cropping needed an image library. It does not:

1. **Do not crop.** Store the boxes as data and render each panel with CSS
   (`background-position`/`object-fit`) or a canvas draw at display time. The original PNG stays the
   only asset. **Recommended** — it is also reversible, so a bad box is re-editable forever.
2. **Crop in the browser** with `<canvas>` + `toBlob()` if real files are wanted. Free, no server.
3. **Crop in pure Node** — genuinely feasible, `zlib` is built in (verified): inflate IDAT, unfilter
   scanlines, crop, refilter, deflate. A few hundred lines and no dependency. Only worth it for
   server-side batch.

### 2.4 What is still genuinely uncertain — and it is ONE thing

Not "can it do boxes" (it can), but: **the documented example grounds ONE region from a
description. Comic panel extraction needs N boxes enumerated in reading order, unprompted.** That is
a different task, and it is where a vision model most plausibly returns *well-formed, plausible,
wrong* output — coordinates that parse cleanly and do not match the page. That failure is invisible
unless something compares them to the image.

**So the first move in Track A4 is a measurement, not a feature** — the pattern that has worked all
session. Roughly 40 lines: post one real `murmel-comics.org/stories/2640` page to `/api/chat` with
`images:[b64]`, ask for panels, parse `<box>`, and render the boxes back over the source image as an
HTML overlay for a human to eyeball. Twenty minutes, and it answers what no amount of planning will:
does it enumerate all panels, in order, at usable precision? Record the answer as a probe with its
numbers in the header, like `probe_word_forms_v79i.js`.

**Reading order is the second unknown** and may be easier solved deterministically: given boxes,
sort top-to-bottom then left-to-right (right-to-left for manga) rather than trusting the model's
sequence. Worth testing both.

### 2.6 The interactive word map (user, at the v80 cut) — build it where coordinates are FREE

**The idea:** overlay the image with the coordinates of the extracted text so the learner can click
a word *in the picture* and get a vocab/grammar question about it.

This is the best fit for the product's own one-line description — *"explore the language of existing
texts"* — that anything in the plan has, and most of it already exists: the question types are
built, `_storyWordSources(d)` already collects "what words does this chapter teach", and the
per-word progress store is keyed by word. **What is new is only the coordinate map and an on-demand
question for an arbitrary word.**

But the difficulty is wildly different per input type, and that should drive the order:

**Tier 0 — born-digital PDF: coordinates are EXACT and FREE.** `pdf.js`'s text layer returns per-item
text with a transform matrix — position, scale, font size — for every text run on the page, with no
model call and no error. **A clickable word map over a PDF page is a rendering exercise, not a
research one.** If §2.5 goes the `pdf.js` route, this feature comes almost free with it. **Build it
here first.** It also proves the whole interaction — hit targets, question-on-click, tracking —
against a source of truth, so that when the image path arrives, only the coordinates are in doubt.

**Tier 1 — images, BUBBLE-level (recommended first image step).** Ask the model for text-block /
speech-bubble boxes, not words: few per panel, coarse, and the same referring-expression shape as
panel grounding — the model's demonstrated strength. Clicking a bubble opens the transcribed text as
**ordinary HTML with each word clickable**. Perfect hit targets, no per-word coordinates needed, and
it degrades gracefully: a slightly wrong bubble box is still a usable click target, whereas a
slightly wrong word box lands on the wrong word and teaches the wrong thing.

**Tier 2 — images, true PER-WORD boxes. This is the speculative one, and it is a real step up.**
A comic page can carry 100+ words. Per-word grounding means either many boxes in one response —
where confabulation risk scales with count and nothing in the output signals it — or one call per
word, which is not affordable. **Do not design around this until the §2.4 overlay probe has run**,
and extend that probe to ask for word boxes in one bubble so both questions are answered by the same
20 minutes of work.

There is also a **derived** option worth testing cheaply: take the bubble box plus the transcribed
string and *estimate* word positions by proportional layout inside the box. Free, no extra tokens,
and probably fine for typeset prose — but comics are hand-lettered with unknown line breaks, so
expect it to fail exactly where it is being asked to work. Test it against Tier 2 output rather than
assuming either way.

**Cheap verification, whichever tier ships:** boxes must lie inside the image bounds, must not
mutually overlap beyond a threshold, and the union of text boxes must account for the extracted
string. None of that needs language knowledge, and it catches the well-formed-but-wrong failure that
is otherwise invisible. **A wrong box is worse than no box** — it silently teaches the learner that a
word means something it does not — so the overlay should fail closed: no confident box, no click
target.

**One product question, not a technical one:** this feature stores and re-displays someone's
artwork with an interactive layer on top. The plan already scopes the corpus to *"known texts w/o
copyright"*; `murmel-comics.org` needs its licence checked before it becomes the demo case, and
user-uploaded images need a decision about whether they are stored server-side at all.

### 2.7 Two REAL pages, read by eye at the v80 cut — what they change

The user supplied two German comics. They bracket the difficulty so well that they should become
the two fixtures for all of Track A. **Everything below is from reading the pages, not from running
a model** — these are the things the §2.4 probe has to be built to catch, not results.

**Page B ("Ein Scheissland", signed M. Lüq) — the EASY case, and the right ACCEPTANCE fixture.**
A clean 2x3 grid of rectangular panels under a title. Caption boxes sit at the top of each panel,
hand-lettered all-caps. Reading order is unambiguous left-to-right, top-to-bottom, so the
deterministic sort proposed in §2.4 is provably enough here. Two pieces of *in-scene* text (a sign
and a banner) sit inside the drawings rather than in caption boxes — a useful wrinkle, because they
must be distinguishable from narration and are exactly the kind of thing a naive "text on page"
extraction flattens together.

**Page A ("Weg? Woanders? Oder nur unsichtbar?") — the HARD case, and the right REGRESSION fixture.**
It defeats four assumptions at once:

1. **Rotated text.** The title runs diagonally; a whole caption runs bottom-to-top at 90 degrees up
   the middle of the page. **Axis-aligned bounding boxes cannot represent this** — the AABB of a
   rotated line overlaps everything beside it, so a per-word click map built on AABBs will put the
   wrong word under the pointer, and the overlap check proposed in §2.6 will fire on correct output.
   Either boxes carry a rotation, or rotated text is detected and excluded.
2. **Unframed content.** A large heart illustration and its caption have no panel border at all.
   **Panel detection by finding rectangles finds nothing there** — grouping has to be semantic.
3. **Text outside the frame.** Captions sit below their panels rather than inside them, so
   "associate text with the panel whose box contains it" is wrong on this page and right on page B.
4. **Genuinely ambiguous reading order.** Where the vertical caption falls relative to the heart
   caption is a judgement a human makes from layout. A top-to-bottom-then-left-to-right sort will
   produce a confident wrong answer.

**The finding that reaches beyond the overlay: WORDS ARE BROKEN ACROSS LINES.** Page A hyphenates
`SON-` / `DERN` across a line break; page B splits `WILL` / `KOMMEN` across lines **with no hyphen
at all**. This breaks three things, only one of which is the word map:

- the map, because one word occupies two disjoint boxes;
- **vocabulary extraction**, because the lesson would teach `son` and `dern` as words;
- **the story text itself**, which would carry the break into every downstream lesson and QC pass.

So de-hyphenation and line-rejoining belong in the extraction step, before anything else sees the
text — and the no-hyphen case means it cannot be done by looking for hyphens. It is a language
judgement, so it is the model's, per INTERNALS section 4.

**The finding with the most pedagogical weight: ALL-CAPS DESTROYS GERMAN NOUN CAPITALISATION.**
Both pages are lettered entirely in capitals. German capitalises nouns, and that distinction is
information a learner is being taught. `KÖPFE`, `MENSCHEN`, `ANGST`, `SCHATZ` must come back as
`Köpfe`, `Menschen`, `Angst`, `Schatz`, while adjectives and verbs must not. **Extraction from
capitals is therefore not transcription, it is restoration**, and the same applies to `SS` -> `ß`
(`GROSSES` -> `großes`, but `SCHEISSLAND` is a judgement). Hand-drawn umlauts are an accuracy risk on
top. None of this is the app's to decide; all of it must be asked for explicitly in the prompt and
then QC'd, because a silently mis-capitalised noun teaches the wrong rule.

**What this implies for the plan:**

- **Ship against page B, regress against page A.** A version that handles B well and *refuses* A
  cleanly is a good version. A version that produces confident boxes for A is a broken one, and
  page A is how you find out.
- **Fail closed becomes a hard requirement, not a nicety** (section 2.6). Page A is the page where
  plausible-but-wrong output is most likely and least detectable.
- **The probe needs GROUND TRUTH**, or it measures nothing. Somebody has to transcribe both pages by
  hand once, into a fixture, including the intended reading order and the restored capitalisation.
  That is an hour of work and it is what makes every later extraction change measurable instead of
  eyeballed.
- **Content curation is not only about copyright.** Page B is pointed political satire; page A is
  about bereavement. Both are legitimate reading material and neither is automatically suitable for
  an arbitrary learner or an auto-generated "meet and greet" corpus. The corpus needs a suitability
  axis alongside the licence one.
- **Page B is signed by an identifiable artist.** The licence question in section 2.6 is live for
  this specific page, not hypothetical.

### 2.5 PDF needs NO decision — corrected again (user, at the v80 cut)

**My §2 draft asked for a PDF ruling that does not exist.** The user's correction: PDF is used for
TEXT only and already works; comics arrive as PNG. Checked, and it is more settled than that:

- **`pdf.js` is already loaded**, from `cdnjs` at `index.html:4394-4402` — the same CDN pattern the
  app already uses for KaTeX. So the "single-file client" property was **already relaxed for exactly
  this**, and nothing new is being decided.
- **Extraction already reads per-item GEOMETRY**, not just strings. `page.getTextContent()` items
  are grouped by `item.transform[5]` (y) and the minimum `item.transform[4]` (x) is kept per line,
  because — as the `v71_b` comment there says — the vertical gap distinguishes a paragraph break
  from a wrap and the left edge marks an indent.

**Rasterisation was never needed.** Delete the option list; there is no dependency question, no
`package.json`, no ruling. The two input paths are simply separate: **PDF/markdown/paste → text,
already built. PNG → vision model, needs nothing new (§2.1).**

**But this has a consequence for §2.6 that runs the other way, and it is good news:** the exact
per-word coordinates the word map wants are **already flowing through `_extractPdfText` and being
discarded.** `content.items` carries a full transform per text run; the current code takes `y` and
the line-minimum `x` and drops the rest. Tier 0 of the word map is therefore not new plumbing — it
is *keeping* what is already read, alongside the text that is already produced. That makes it the
cheapest place in the whole plan to build and prove the click-a-word interaction, against
coordinates that cannot be wrong.

One caveat to measure rather than assume: pdf.js emits text *runs*, not words. A run may be several
words or part of one, so word-level boxes need splitting a run by character widths — approximate,
but bounded and checkable, and vastly better than the image case.

### 2.6 The interactive word map (user, at the v80 cut) — build it where coordinates are FREE

**The idea:** overlay the image with the coordinates of the extracted text so the learner can click
a word *in the picture* and get a vocab/grammar question about it.

per-word progress store is keyed by word. **What is new is only the coordinate map and an on-demand
question for an arbitrary word.**

But the difficulty is wildly different per input type, and that should drive the order:

**The finding that reaches beyond the overlay: WORDS ARE BROKEN ACROSS LINES.** Page A hyphenates
`SON-` / `DERN` across a line break; page B splits `WILL` / `KOMMEN` across lines **with no hyphen
at all**. This breaks three things, only one of which is the word map:

- the map, because one word occupies two disjoint boxes;
- **vocabulary extraction**, because the lesson would teach `son` and `dern` as words;
- **the story text itself**, which would carry the break into every downstream lesson and QC pass.

So de-hyphenation and line-rejoining belong in the extraction step, before anything else sees the
text — and the no-hyphen case means it cannot be done by looking for hyphens. It is a language
judgement, so it is the model's, per INTERNALS section 4.

**The finding with the most pedagogical weight: ALL-CAPS DESTROYS GERMAN NOUN CAPITALISATION.**
Both pages are lettered entirely in capitals. German capitalises nouns, and that distinction is
information a learner is being taught. `KÖPFE`, `MENSCHEN`, `ANGST`, `SCHATZ` must come back as
`Köpfe`, `Menschen`, `Angst`, `Schatz`, while adjectives and verbs must not. **Extraction from
capitals is therefore not transcription, it is restoration**, and the same applies to `SS` -> `ß`
(`GROSSES` -> `großes`, but `SCHEISSLAND` is a judgement). Hand-drawn umlauts are an accuracy risk on
top. None of this is the app's to decide; all of it must be asked for explicitly in the prompt and
then QC'd, because a silently mis-capitalised noun teaches the wrong rule.

**What this implies for the plan:**

- **Ship against page B, regress against page A.** A version that handles B well and *refuses* A
  cleanly is a good version. A version that produces confident boxes for A is a broken one, and
  page A is how you find out.
- **Fail closed becomes a hard requirement, not a nicety** (section 2.6). Page A is the page where
  plausible-but-wrong output is most likely and least detectable.
- **The probe needs GROUND TRUTH**, or it measures nothing. Somebody has to transcribe both pages by
  hand once, into a fixture, including the intended reading order and the restored capitalisation.
  That is an hour of work and it is what makes every later extraction change measurable instead of
  eyeballed.
- **Content curation is not only about copyright.** Page B is pointed political satire; page A is
  about bereavement. Both are legitimate reading material and neither is automatically suitable for
  an arbitrary learner or an auto-generated "meet and greet" corpus. The corpus needs a suitability
  axis alongside the licence one.
- **Page B is signed by an identifiable artist.** The licence question in section 2.6 is live for
  this specific page, not hypothetical.

### 2.5 PDF is the only case that still needs a decision

A PDF is not an image; feeding it to a vision model requires **rasterising** it first, and that is
the one step with no built-in. Options:

- **Rasterise in the browser** with `pdf.js` from a CDN → canvas → PNG → the exact same vision path
  as 2.1. One code path for PDFs and comics both. Costs the single-file client property for the live
  app and needs a decision for `docs/index.html`.
- **Text-layer-only fast path**: `pdf.js` can extract an existing text layer with no model call at
  all — free and exact for born-digital PDFs, which is most uploaded prose. Fall back to
  rasterise+vision for scans and comics.
- Accept a Node dependency (**needs an explicit ruling**, ends a long-held invariant).

**Recommendation: browser `pdf.js` doing text-layer-first, rasterise-on-fallback, feeding the
existing chat+images path.** Images need no library at all; PDFs need only a client-side one; the
server stays zero-dependency in every case.

## 3. Track C — the surface clean-up (do this first)

Ordered so that each session ends shippable. Every one of these lands on `probe_gates_v77.js`
territory; **re-run and diff against `v80_card_gates.txt`** (the `v77` table is superseded, and the
`v80` baseline exists because the drop moved it).

### C1. Progress-card structural fixes (1 session) — the BUGS first, before any cosmetics

Two of the plan's items are **defects**, not design, and they should not wait behind the cosmetic
list:

- **"I browsed forward to the story card and back, solved no comprehension lesson, yet could
  proceed to the next chapter."**
- **"Via the replay button or otherwise, I could play the comprehension lessons BEFORE the
  chapter-story was unlocked."**

These are the same suspicion from both sides: **the gate is being computed from render state rather
than from lesson state**, so navigation can move the learner past a gate that never opened. They
are also the two items most likely to be *masked* by the cosmetic rework, so measure them before
touching the cards.

**First move is a probe, not an edit** — the pattern that worked for the fork task. Drive
`chapterComplete`, `lessonCountsFor`/`countedLessons` and the unlock gate directly, reproduce both
sequences, and report what each says before and after. Fold in the **single-chapter 100% bar**
(§0.3) here, since it is the same helper (`_slProgressStats` adding one for the in-progress
chapter) and the same screen.

**Also here:** the storyline header bar being partially green before any question — the plan reads
this as an index-off-by-one ("current-1"). **Verify that before implementing it**; the same helper
produces the 100%-on-one-chapter result, so a single root cause may explain both, and fixing them
as two off-by-ones would leave the real one.

### C2. Progress-card content and copy (1 session)

Low-risk, high-visibility, all guarded by the gate probe:

- third progress bar for comprehension lessons on the entry card;
- the bottom-row message replaced by the **chapter title** on all card states (entry, in-progress,
  unlocked-in-green) — one change applied consistently, so build it as one helper with a state
  argument, not four call sites;
- post-unlock questions labelled **"text comprehension"** rather than by the next chapter's name.
  **Check `ui.json` for an existing key first** — the plan says to reuse one if present, and adding
  a key means 33 languages;
- the "next chapter unlocked!" card **removed from the flow**, going straight to the next entry
  card;
- entry card shows the story summary as the storyline page does, **default uncollapsed**;
- chapter entry cards ≥2 remodelled to match chapter 1.

**Watch for:** removing a card from the flow interacts with C1's navigation bug. Do C1 first or the
two fixes will be hard to attribute.

### C3. Read-out everywhere (1 session)

Speech buttons on every vocabulary field and every chapter text field, on the final card too, with
**each item read in its own language** (vocab in target, translation in source). Clicking an
individual vocab item reads it.

This is the natural home for **"show the no-TTS-available message when the user clicks speech and
that language has no voice"** — the app already has `_ttsNoVoice` and the 🗣 pill for exactly this,
so it is wiring, not new behaviour. It also inherits `v79_n`'s `_speechLocaleFor`, so per-chapter
speech locale applies automatically. **`unit-speech-locale` §11 already guards that a voice picked
for one language never speaks another** — the property this feature depends on most.

### C4. The Settings Card and floating pills (1–2 sessions) — the biggest UI change here

A cog pill next to the login pill on **all** pages, including static, absorbing: the UI control row,
speech-language setting, model selection, sound test, missing-UI-entries, teacher mode, import,
static export, learners. Plus a **global mute pill** replacing every scattered mute button — while
keeping all read-out buttons, which are a different thing.

**Three specific risks, from this session's scars:**

1. **The static build re-implements client functions.** `build-static.js` overrides 19 of them.
   `unit-static-selectlang-tts` now guards that overrides keep their live twin's UI-refresh calls —
   **extend its `REFRESHERS` list as the SC adds refreshers.** The list is a judgement, and the test
   says so.
2. **"Available in the static page" is a requirement, not a footnote.** Model selection, import and
   learners have no meaning without a server. Decide per item whether it is *hidden* or *disabled
   with a reason* in static mode, and write the decision down — a silently missing control reads as
   a bug.
3. **The mute consolidation touches `data-mute-tip`/`updateMuteButtons`**, which already has a
   guard (`unit-tts-test-row`) that broke twice this session on text-level pins. Expect to
   re-anchor it, and re-anchor at the claim.

### C5. Generation Card, QC Card, flag pill (1–2 sessions)

- Generation moves off the main page into its own card, aligned with the storyline and
  "add lesson" entry points — **this is the resurrected `§0i` from `roadmap_v79.md`** (§0.2), which
  was marked BLOCKED on §1; check what that block was before assuming it is gone.
- QC bulk actions get a card with **selectable QC types** (already in the old roadmap).
- The download-flagged pill shrinks to a filled-flag pill, expanding on click, with a
  **guarded "clear all flags"** and clearing on GitHub-link click.

### C6. LMGTFY widget (half a session, do it as a filler)

Self-contained and genuinely small: extend a story-interpretation prompt to emit a list of unusual
or technical terms (`«programma di ricerca»` in `tp_17851387238120000029`), render a collapsible
floating widget of search links, search engine settable in the SC.

**Two notes.** The prompt must call `scriptPinNote` if it emits target-language text —
`unit-script-pin-coverage` **sweeps the source** and a new prompt fails until classified. And
"words the model itself doesn't recognise" is a self-report; treat the list as a *suggestion
surface*, never as a claim about the language, per the "no language knowledge in the code"
principle.

---

## 4. Track E — export (1 session, no dependencies, do it early)

Printable **(a) exams** (MCQ + text fields) and **(b) teaching material** (full story with vocab
highlights, full translation without). Both are pure transforms of data that already exists, and
`_storyWordSources(d)` is already the single collector for "what words does this chapter teach".

**Print, not PDF-generation.** A print stylesheet plus a print-optimised render costs nothing and
sidesteps §2 entirely; the browser makes the PDF. Only reach for real PDF generation if you need
server-side batch export, and that is a Track A decision.

This is the item I would slot into any session that finishes early.

---

## 5. Track D — lesson types (1 session each, but ONE needs a ruling first)

### D1. Mixed-lesson composition (1 session)

Let the user pick which lessons join a mixed lesson via a dropdown of the chapter's lesson
ids/titles/types. The plan notes this could optionally include **all lessons of previous chapters**
and thereby **replace reinforce/extend**. That is the more interesting half and the riskier one:
replacing an existing feature deserves its own decision and its own release, not a checkbox in a
dropdown release. **Split it: composition first, reinforce/extend replacement second.**

### D2. Cases and articles — NEEDS A RULING, and it is the "no language knowledge" line

The plan asks for noun cases and definite/indefinite article distinctions (`der/die/das`,
`ein/eine`; `ova/ovo` vs `taj/ta/to`), and explicitly anticipates *"a table languages × lesson
types to indicate whether a given lesson type makes sense in that language"*.

**That table is language knowledge in the app**, and `INTERNALS.md` §4 makes its absence a design
principle with a documented list of known violations. The project has already ruled this way once,
in a neighbouring case: the `cyrillic-sr` sounds column was authored, mechanically verified, and
**reverted**, because its absence enforces a `v75_g` ruling — and `unit-intro-script` catches its
return.

So this needs an explicit decision, and there is a middle path worth considering: **let the MODEL
declare per-language applicability at generation time and cache the answer as data** (in
`languages.json`), rather than the app encoding a table. That keeps the knowledge in the tier
INTERNALS §4 assigns it to, and the cache is then a measurement, not a claim.

The "reveal the full phrase, correct article and word form together" part needs no ruling and can
ship independently.

### D3. Generic, story-independent lessons (1 session)

A user prompt field producing lessons not tied to a story ("train colour names, include brown").
The plan's own scoping is right: **standard vocabulary first**, one lesson type, one prompt field,
following the existing LLM-math precedent. Note the new prompt needs `scriptPinNote` (§C6) and a
`_genMeta` record like every other generator.

---

## 6. Track F — QC rework (1 session, mostly independent)

Ordered by how much each is worth:

**F1. Word-forms QC: detect distractors that also make an error-free sentence.** This is the same
defect `probe_word_forms_v79i.js` measures, now stated as a QC job. **Read the probe's header
first**: it is explicitly *"a measuring instrument for a human, NOT a validator — rejecting these
mechanically would mean the app encoding per-language grammar, which the model owns."* So F1 must
be **model adjudication**, not a deterministic rule, or it walks straight into §5's problem.

Also carry forward the `v80` finding: the regenerated lesson went from *5 items all two-choice* to
*6 items with 1 two-choice*, while the corpus-wide percentage stayed flat at 15% because
un-regenerated lessons dominate the denominator. **QC on old lessons is therefore worth more than
another prompt revision**, and F1 is how you get it.

**F2. The malformed word-forms items** in `tp_586040741` — the blanked word shown in the sentence
with the underline appended at the end (`"...across the path.___"`, answer `cast`). This one **is**
deterministic and safe: the item is broken as *structure*, independent of language — the answer
token appears in the stem and the blank is not where the word was. No language knowledge needed.
**Do this one first; it is the cheapest real win in the whole document.**

**F3. THE ARTICLE MESS — diagnosed at the v80 cut. It is a rule-31 case, and the "fixes" are why it
got worse.**

The user reports German->French vocab in `tp_17869977371640000022` full of pairs where the German
side carries an article and the French side does not. Both languages HAVE articles, so this is not a
"one language lacks them" case. **The generation prompt contains two rules that contradict each
other**, and the contradiction is not subtle once both are read together. From `prompts.json`,
`vocab.system`, in this order:

1. `BASE FORM ONLY: give every vocab word in its dictionary/citation form — verbs in the infinitive,
   nouns in the singular (with the usual article where the language uses one)`
2. `ARTICLE SYMMETRY for nouns: give the article on BOTH sides ("der Hund" <-> "il cane") or on
   NEITHER side ("Hund" <-> "cane") — never an article on one side only.`

**Rule 1 is PER-SIDE and appeals to each language's own citation convention. Rule 2 is a CROSS-SIDE
constraint.** They cannot both be satisfied for a pair whose two languages have different
lexicographic conventions — and German/French is exactly that pair: German dictionaries cite nouns
**with** the definite article because it carries gender (`der Hund`), French dictionaries cite the
bare noun with a gender tag (`chien, n.m.`). **A model following rule 1 faithfully produces
`der Hund` <-> `chien`, which is precisely the reported defect.** Rule 1 is stated first and is
framed as the definitional rule ("BASE FORM ONLY"), so it wins.

**Why it got WORSE with the attempts to fix it — three compounding reasons:**

- **The symmetry rule was ADDED next to the contradicting clause rather than reconciling it**
  (rule 31: *before strengthening an instruction, check whether it is already there and being
  CONTRADICTED*). This is the same failure as `v79_i`, where the word-forms prompt banned indecidable
  distractors and recommended them three bullets earlier. Adding a prohibition beside a live
  contradiction does not remove the contradiction; it makes the prompt longer and the behaviour less
  predictable.
- **A deterministic normaliser was removed for good reasons, and nothing replaced its coverage.**
  `server.js:4438` records it: the old code split `hail` into `grandine`/`hail` and *"dropped the
  gender an Italian learner needs while symmetric siblings in the same lesson kept theirs. It made
  lessons LESS consistent than it found them."* Removing it was right — but the comment then says
  *"the generation prompt still forbids a one-sided article; QC is the safety net"*, and the
  generation prompt does **not** forbid it cleanly, because of rule 1. **The safety net was hung on
  a claim that is not true.**
- **The QC check is context-dependent and degrades quietly.** `qcCheckPair` takes `siblings` — the
  other vocab items in the same lesson — and `server.js:1536` states that omitting them *"degrades
  the article check to a judgement without context"*. So the check's strength varies with what it is
  handed, and a lesson generated wholly one-sided gives it consistent-looking siblings to agree with.

**A fourth contradiction, across prompts:** `vocab` asks for nouns **with** the article; `grammar`
asks for `"{L} noun in singular form (no article)"` and adds `"target" must have no article
prepended`, carrying the article in a separate field. Two lesson types, two opposite conventions for
the same noun. That is defensible per lesson type but it means "the article convention" is not one
thing in this codebase, and any fix must say which convention applies where.

**The fix, in order, and NOT another sentence of prohibition:**

1. **Remove the contradiction.** Rule 1's parenthetical `(with the usual article where the language
   uses one)` is the clause to change — it is what invokes per-language citation convention. Decide
   which convention wins for vocab pairs and state it ONCE.
2. **Add a WORKED COUNTER-EXAMPLE, not a rule.** The word-forms prompt was fixed this way in
   `v79_i`: a shown broken item plus its repair. Here that is `der Hund <-> chien` marked BROKEN,
   with `der Hund <-> le chien` and `Hund <-> chien` both shown as acceptable.
3. **Then measure.** A probe over the corpus counting one-sided-article pairs per language pair,
   with the numbers in its header, so "it got worse" stops being an impression. **The `v80` lesson
   applies: the corpus-wide rate cannot move until lessons are REGENERATED, so measure per
   `_genMeta.at` cohort, not in aggregate** — that is exactly how the word-forms improvement was
   nearly missed.
4. **Only then** revisit whether the QC check should be strengthened. It may be adequate once it is
   no longer compensating for a self-contradicting prompt.

**Note this is downstream of the D1 ruling.** "Does this language use articles at all" is now a
model-declared, cached fact — so the symmetry rule can consult data instead of asking the model to
re-derive it inside every generation.

**F3c. MEASURED at the v80 drop — the contradiction produces a COIN FLIP, not a constant bias.**

The user reported that chapter 1 of the new German->French storyline had the asymmetry and chapter 2
did not. Measured on the drop:

| chapter | asymmetric vocab pairs |
|---|---|
| `tp_17869977371640000022` "Stille vor dem Winter" | **7 of 8** |
| `tp_17869980065780000104` "Brücke der Existenz" | **0 of 8** |

And the two are **generated identically**: same model (`qwen3.6:35b-a3b`), same `_genMeta.type`
(`standard`), `rejected: 0` on both, **four minutes apart**. No different prompt, no different code
path, no retry that could explain it.

**This is the strongest available evidence for the rule-31 diagnosis**, and it sharpens it: a
self-contradicting instruction does not bias the output consistently, it makes the outcome
**unstable** — the model resolves the conflict differently from sample to sample. Two consequences:

- **It explains "seems to have gotten worse".** With a coin flip, a run of bad luck reads exactly
  like a regression, and a run of good luck reads exactly like a fix. Neither impression is
  measuring anything.
- **Therefore a single lesson can never validate the fix.** N=1 cannot distinguish "corrected" from
  "got lucky", and chapter 2 above is precisely a lucky sample of the broken prompt. **The F3 probe
  must sample MANY lessons per `_genMeta.at` cohort and report a RATE with its denominator**, not an
  example.

The failure direction also confirms the mechanism exactly: every asymmetric pair has the German
source carrying the article (`das Eichhörnchen`, `der Winter`, `die Begegnung`) and the French target
bare (`écureuil`, `hiver`, `rencontre`) — German citation convention applied on one side, French on
the other, which is what rule 1's `(with the usual article where the language uses one)` asks for.

**F3b. QC PROMPTS BELONG IN `prompts.json` (user, v80 cut).** Partly true already: `storyQc` and
`srcRepair` live there and are read via `fillPrompt(PROMPTS.storyQc.system, ...)`. **The lesson-level
QC prompt is still inline in `server.js`.** Moving it is small, but the user's second clause is the
valuable half — *"more systematically aligned with the generating prompts"*. The article mess is the
argument for it: **a QC prompt that checks a convention lives in a different file from the
generation prompt that sets it, so the two drift and nobody notices.** Pairing them — same file,
adjacent keys, ideally a shared fragment for any rule both must state — is what would have made this
contradiction visible. Do it as part of the F3 fix, not separately.

**F4. Run-level QC token accounting** (§0.4) — small, do it alongside the QC card.

---

## 7. Track A — ingest (multi-session; blocked on §2)

Sequenced so each step is independently useful:

1. **A1 — plain text / markdown upload with a separate chaptering card.** No §2 dependency at all,
   and it builds the chaptering UI that PDF and comics will reuse. **Also delivers the plan's
   "allow to edit the source field when generating from an uploaded text"**, which appears twice in
   the plan and is small.
2. **A2 — language detection**, both the cheap script-based path and the LLM query. The
   script-based half already has machinery: `backfill-script.js` and the `script` stamp.
3. **A3 — the PDF word map** (§2.5/§2.6 Tier 0), not PDF extraction, which already works. Keep the
   per-item transforms `_extractPdfText` currently discards.
4. **A4 — comics via vision model.** Needs no dependency and no PDF ruling, so it can start
   BEFORE A3. **Begin with the §2.4 overlay probe** against `murmel-comics.org/stories/2640`: boxes
   drawn back over the source page, eyeballed by a human, numbers recorded in the probe header.
   Panel *enumeration* and reading order are the unknowns, not OCR.

**Check `/api/generate-book` first** — it exists at `server.js:6515` and may already do part of A1.
And `roadmap_v80.md` §0b records import **"new" mode as POSTPONED by the user**; A1 overlaps it, so
reconcile rather than re-decide.

---

## 8. Track B — pedagogy (UNBLOCKED; staged so each step stands alone)

`bayesian_knowledge_tracing.md` is in `build_history/`. §0.1 evaluates it. The staging below follows
from that evaluation, and its shape is: **instrument, then tag, then run BKT in the dark, then
show it, and only then — maybe — let it control anything.**

**B1 — the observations log (do this FIRST, and it can start today).** Append-only, per §13:
`{userId, skillId, correct, evidence, storylineId, lessonId, timestamp}`. Two properties matter more
than the schema: **record the FIRST attempt distinctly from retries** (§0.1's measurement), and
record even when `skillId` is unknown — an observation tagged `null` is recoverable later, an
observation never written is gone. **This is worth doing before any of Track A**, because every day
it runs is a day of evidence BKT will have, and the existing counters cannot be replayed into it.

**B2 — the skill registry and canonicalisation.** The piece §0.1(c) says the document omits. Model
proposes an ID, the app resolves it against existing entries, near-misses are merged, and the
resolution is recorded so a wrong merge is reversible. **Build the registry before the taggers**, or
every tagger will mint its own dialect. This is also where the `de:` / language prefix and the
target-vs-source question from §0.1(b) get settled.

**B3 — tag NEW lessons at generation.** One lesson type first (vocabulary — the same choice §D3
makes, and `_storyWordSources(d)` already collects the words). Every prompt that gains a skill field
must still call `scriptPinNote` and record `_genMeta`. Do **not** backfill 321 topics until one type
has been through QC.

**B4 — BKT in SHADOW MODE.** Compute `pMastery` and show it nowhere. Run it alongside the existing
`chapterComplete`/pass-mark gate and **log where the two disagree.** This is the measurement that
tells you whether §5/§6 are worth adopting, and it costs nothing if the answer is no. It also
surfaces the 97%-correct saturation problem (§0.1) as data rather than as a prediction.

**B5 — surface it read-only.** The §11 aggregate views (vocabulary/grammar/word-forms/reading), and
§8's corpus-vs-independent split, which is free once `evidence` is recorded. Still controlling
nothing.

**B6 — the scoped tutor.** *Not* the adaptive tutor of the user's §4 — the small one: a chapter-
scoped window that knows the story up to and specifically about this chapter. It is independently
useful, needs no BKT, and belongs with Track C's card work. §9's confidence-weighted chat evidence
comes much later and needs an update rule the document does not specify.

**B7 — mastery-driven progression (§5/§6). A PRODUCT DECISION, and possibly never.** It replaces a
gate the user has ruled on repeatedly. Do not start it without an explicit ruling, and not before B4
has shown what would actually change.

**B8 — the corpus.** Automated meet & greet lessons like `sl_1271936135`, plus out-of-copyright
texts. A content project as much as a code one, and it gates recommendation (§6 of the user plan):
a recommender over 90 storylines recommends the same things to everyone.

**B9 — prerequisites and CEFR (§14, §11).** Last. **CEFR mapping is the same language-knowledge
ruling as §5's languages x lesson-types table** — a CEFR level per skill is a language judgement, so
it belongs in data the model fills, not in a table the app ships.

**Still true, and it constrains B4 hardest:** at a 3.0% error rate a difficulty policy has almost no
learner signal to work with and must come from corpus statistics first. The two measurements already
identified remain the right prerequisites — **inflection share** and **learner-known share** — and
one pass over the same inventory yields both.

## 9. Cross-cutting risks

**R1 — The single file is at 1.14 MB.** Every track adds to it. Nothing in the plan addresses it,
and `check-inline.js` runtime and browser parse time both scale with it. **Decide before Track A
whether the client stays one file**, because the ingest UI is the largest single addition proposed.

**R2 — The static build will drift again.** It re-implements 19 functions. Every card in Track C
either works in static mode or is deliberately absent, and `unit-static-selectlang-tts` only guards
the refresher pairing. **Expect to extend that guard once per Track C session.**

**R3 — Pricing implies auth, and auth is nowhere in this plan.** "Requires subscription to stably
store progress", "only direct LLM use will cost" — none of that exists today. It is at least its own
track and possibly its own product decision. **It should not be discovered mid-Track-B.**

**R4 — The plan has no failure mode for the model.** Ingest, tutor, QC adjudication and term
extraction all assume a working LLM. The app already handles "no LLM" gracefully; each new
model-dependent feature needs the same, and the plan's own pricing model makes some of them
*expected* to be unavailable.

**R5 — Rule 24 applies to this document.** It is a plan, not a guard. Nothing here is protected
until it is a test.

---

## 9b. THE DECISIONS STILL OUTSTANDING — the complete list

Everything else in this document is buildable without asking. These are not.

**D1. The languages x lesson-types table — RULED at the v80 cut (user chose the proposed option).**

**Applicability is MODEL-DECLARED, CACHED AS DATA, TERNARY, WITH PROVENANCE.** Not a table the app
ships, and not a question asked at every generation.

The argument that decided it, kept because it is the reason and not just the outcome: the plan's own
example proposed *"ova/ovo vs. taj/ta/to"* as Serbian articles. **Serbian has no articles.** Those
are demonstratives, and the nearer analogue to definiteness in Serbian is **adjective aspect** —
the definite/indefinite adjective forms (`star` / `stari`) — a different mechanism on a different
word class. So the cell "Serbian x articles" is neither `true` nor `false`, and the honest answer
*"no articles; definiteness surfaces through adjective morphology"* is **more useful to the
generator than the boolean**, because it says what to teach instead. A boolean table is wrong on its
first interesting cell, and the interesting cells are the only ones needing a table at all.

**The shape:**

- **Ternary plus a note**, never boolean: `yes` / `no` / `different-mechanism`, with a sentence.
  The note is what turns a refused "cases" request for Italian into a useful preposition lesson.
- **Cached in `languages.json`**, keyed by `(language, lessonType)`, **with `_genMeta`-style
  provenance** — model, date, prompt version — exactly as lessons carry it. That is what makes this
  a MEASUREMENT rather than an authored claim, which is the tier INTERNALS §4 permits, and what
  makes it re-derivable when the prompt improves and auditable when it is wrong.
- **A human override wins and is MARKED as an override**, distinguishable from a cached answer. The
  user is the language authority this project trusts (`v75_g` is exactly that), and an override that
  looks like a cache entry loses the ruling behind it.
- **Asked once, not per generation.** Per-generation is non-deterministic — the same language must
  not get a conjugation lesson on Tuesday and not on Wednesday — and pays tokens repeatedly for a
  stable fact.

**Why not the alternatives:** a hand-authored table scales badly across two growing axes (33
languages x ~14 types) and caps quality at the maintainer's linguistics; no gating at all produces
the incoherent lessons this is meant to prevent.

**The honest cost, recorded rather than glossed:** a wrong CACHED answer is stickier than a wrong
per-call one, because nothing re-asks. Provenance is the mitigation — a prompt-version change can
invalidate and re-derive the affected cells.

**Guard it the way this project already guards this shape:** a source SWEEP that fails when a lesson
type has no applicability policy, mirroring `unit-script-pin-coverage`, which sweeps the source so a
new prompt cannot skip `scriptPinNote`. Rule 32 — guard the enumeration, not the cells that happened
to get filled.

**Scope limit:** this decides only whether a lesson is OFFERED. Whether the generated lesson is any
good remains QC's problem (§F). And the other half of the original request — **revealing the full
phrase with the correct article and word form together** — needs no table and can ship at any time.

*Unblocks: D2 (cases/articles), D3 (generic lessons) partly, B9 (CEFR, same mechanism).*

**D2. Mastery-driven progression (BKT §5/§6, plan §8/B7).** Replaces the `coverageTarget` pass mark
you have ruled on repeatedly. §8/B4 runs BKT in shadow mode first, so this can be decided from a
disagreement log instead of a prediction. **Do not decide it now** — decide it when B4 has data.
*Blocks: B7 only.*

**D3. Corpus licence AND suitability.** `murmel-comics.org` page B is signed by an identifiable
artist, so the licence question is concrete, not hypothetical. Separately, suitability is its own
axis: page B is political satire, page A is about bereavement — both legitimate reading, neither
automatically right for an auto-generated beginner corpus. *Blocks: B8, and the comic demo.*

**D4. Uploaded images — RULED: STORED SERVER-SIDE (user, v80 cut).**

Three consequences that follow immediately and are design constraints, not opinions:

- **Images must NOT go into `lessons.json`.** It is a single JSON file that every test loads, that
  `build-static.js` bakes wholesale, and that the corpus checks parse repeatedly. Base64 comic pages
  would multiply its size by orders of magnitude and slow the entire suite. **Store as files in an
  asset directory, reference by path from the topic record** — the same relationship `docs/` already
  has to the corpus.
- **The static build needs a decision it does not have yet.** `build-static.js` bakes lessons into
  `docs/index.html`; it cannot bake megabytes of PNG. Either the static export omits images (and
  image-derived chapters degrade to text-only), or it copies assets alongside and rewrites paths.
  **Cheapest honest answer: text-only in static, and say so in the UI** rather than shipping a
  storyline whose pages silently fail to load.
- **Retention makes D3 sharper, not softer.** Storing a signed artist's page server-side is a
  stronger act than transiently reading it. The licence question moves from "can we display this"
  to "can we host this".

**D5. Does the client stay ONE file?** `index.html` is 1.14 MB with a ~972 KB inline script, and the
ingest UI is the largest single addition proposed. Note §2.5 shows the property is **already**
partly relaxed — pdf.js and KaTeX both load from CDN — so the question is where the line actually
is, not whether to cross it. *Blocks: nothing immediately; gets harder the longer it waits.*

**D6. Observations log scope — RULED: BOTH, keyed by a stable local id an account can adopt
(user, v80 cut).** Payment and accounts remain open; this decides only the key, which was the part
that blocks §8/B1.

**The design that follows, with the traps named:**

- A client-generated stable id (UUID) in `localStorage`, written on first observation. Every
  observation carries it. No account needed to start recording — which is what makes B1 startable
  now.
- **Adoption must be a LINK, not a rename.** An account accumulates a SET of local ids: one per
  browser and device. Re-keying observations to a `userId` loses the ability to adopt a second
  browser later, and breaks if two devices are adopted in either order.
- **Therefore an observation's identity key is the local id, permanently**, and `userId` is a
  resolved attribute. This is the choice that is expensive to reverse, so it is stated here rather
  than discovered at implementation.
- **Two traps to handle explicitly:** a browser adopted by account A and later signed into account
  B (the observations do not move — they were A's evidence when made), and clearing `localStorage`
  (the evidence is orphaned, not lost; an un-adopted id is simply never claimed).
- Pseudonymous by construction, which is the right default for evidence collected before anyone has
  agreed to anything.

**D7. Does mixed-lesson composition REPLACE reinforce/extend (§D1)?** Replacing a shipped feature
deserves its own release and its own decision, not a checkbox. *Blocks: the second half of D1.*

**D8. Duplicate storyline titles — RESOLVED IN THE DATA (user renamed one to "Dough of the
Ancients 2" at the v80 cut).**

The earlier ruling was "keep both identical", which would have broken the `v79_k` fork marker for
that pair. The rename removes the defect at its source and is the better fix — the marker renders
the other storyline's `icon + title`, and two distinguishable titles is exactly what it needs.

**The guard is still worth building, but it is now PREVENTIVE, not corrective**, and should be
described that way rather than as a bug fix: for every fork in the corpus, the marker must be
distinguishable from the open storyline's own label. Nothing in the data enforces unique titles, so
a future duplicate would silently reproduce the defect. `unit-fork-display` already sweeps forks and
can carry the assertion in a few lines. **Lower priority than it was — it now protects against a
recurrence rather than fixing a live problem.**

**Note for the next data drop:** the tree at this cut still carries the OLD duplicate titles; the
rename lives in the user's copy. The next `lessons.json` will bring it, and a title change is
exactly the kind of quiet data movement the session protocol says to diff for rather than assume.

## 9c. THE STORYLINE TITLE IS NEVER GENERATED FOR A NEW BOOK — diagnosed at the v80 cut

**User report:** generating a multi-chapter German->French storyline skipped the title with
`Storyline title: keeping existing "ein eichhoernchen trifft ein murmeltier — 1"`, and the title had
to be made by hand afterwards.

**Diagnosed, and it is a precondition that stopped being true.** `server.js:5348` guards the title
generation with `v78_r`'s rule — *"only when there is none. A continuation must not rename a
storyline the learner already has"* — which is correct and was a user ruling. But the storyline
record is created **earlier in the same flow**, at `server.js:5207` and `5215`:

```js
upsertStoryline({ id: slId, title: chain[0], icon: '📖', chapters: chapterIds, ... })
```

`chain[0]` is the FIRST CHAPTER'S TOPIC NAME — here `"ein eichhoernchen trifft ein murmeltier — 1"`,
complete with the auto-numbering suffix. **So by the time the guard asks "is there a title?", there
always is one.** The `else` branch that calls `generateStorylineTitle` is unreachable for any
storyline created through this path. The title is not skipped because the storyline is a
continuation; it is skipped because a PLACEHOLDER was seeded as if it were an authored title.

**The guard is right and must not be weakened** — `v78_r` exists because regenerating a title from
the new chapters alone replaced a whole-story title with one about its tail. The fix is to make the
guard able to tell a placeholder from a real title. Options, in preference order:

1. **Do not seed a title at all** for a new storyline (`title: ''` or omitted), letting the existing
   guard do exactly what it says. Cleanest, but every reader of `sl.title` must tolerate an empty
   one until the post-pass runs — check the storyline list, the fork marker (which renders
   `icon + title`), and `build-static.js`.
2. **Mark the placeholder** — `titleAuto: true`, cleared when a real title is generated or the user
   edits it. Explicit, survives a crash between the two steps, and makes "was this authored?"
   answerable elsewhere too. **Recommended.**
3. Compare `sl.title` to `chain[0]` and treat equality as absent. Cheapest, and wrong the moment a
   user deliberately names a storyline after its first chapter.

**Guard it where the claim is observable:** a new multi-chapter book gets a title that is NOT its
first chapter's topic name, and an EXISTING storyline gaining a chapter keeps its title unchanged.
Both halves are needed — the second is the `v78_r` ruling, and a fix that only asserts the first
would re-open it.

**Scope checked, not assumed:** the same `_slPre2` pattern guards the storyline SUMMARY at
`server.js:5373`, but **`summary` is never seeded** by `upsertStoryline` — the only writes are the
generated one and the user's edit. So the summary guard works as intended and **this is a
title-only bug**. Fix the title; leave the summary path alone.

## 10. Suggested next three sessions — revised after the v80 rulings

Four decisions landed at this cut (§9b D1, D4, D6, D8), which changes what is startable.

1. **Repair and reconcile.** The two restored roadmap sections at the top of `roadmap_v80.md`'s open
   block — strike what this plan supersedes **with a pointer**, keep what is still open. Then
   `unit-story-unlocked-page` §6, the guard that does not discriminate under revert. Ends with a
   roadmap that describes reality and one fewer guard that cannot fail.

2. **C1 — the two progress-card gate bugs**, measured before edited (browse-forward-and-back skipping
   comprehension; replay reaching comprehension before the story unlocked), with the
   single-chapter 100% bar and the header-bar off-by-one folded in, since all three may share a root
   cause in `_slProgressStats`. Highest user-visible value in the document.

3. **Either of two now-unblocked one-session items**, whichever suits:
   - **§8/B1, the observations log** — unblocked by D6. Append-only, first-attempt distinct from
     retries, local-id keyed, recording even when `skillId` is unknown. **The only item whose value
     DECAYS while it waits**, because the existing `{seen, wrong}` counters cannot be replayed.
   - **The applicability cache** (D1) — model call, ternary + note, provenance, sweep guard. No UI,
     no migration, and it is the prerequisite for cases/articles lessons and for CEFR.

**Small and independent, for any session that finishes early:** the fork-marker fallback (D8, half a
session, `unit-fork-display` already has the sweep), **F2** the malformed word-forms detector — the
cheapest real win in the document — and **Track E**, printable export.

**Still open, and none of it blocks the above:** the corpus licence and suitability question (D3,
now sharper since images are retained), payment and accounts beyond the key design (D6), whether the
client stays one file (D5, which only gets harder), and whether mixed lessons replace
reinforce/extend (D7). **Mastery-driven progression (D2) should NOT be decided until §8/B4 has run
BKT in shadow mode and produced a disagreement log** — deciding it now would be guessing.
