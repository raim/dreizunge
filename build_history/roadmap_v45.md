# Dreizunge — roadmap v45

State at start of this roadmap: app is **v44** (server `APP_VERSION`, `/api/info`
+ visible label, live + static). Single `server.js` + `index.html`;
`build-static.js` bakes `docs/index.html`; data in `lessons.json`, strings in
`ui.json` (new English-only keys go in the `en` block), prompts in `prompts.json`.

## Standing workflow (unchanged)
Per change: new UI strings → `ui.json` `en` only, rendered via `t()`; after each
change run `node --check server.js`, syntax-check the inline script
(`node test/check-inline.js index.html`), rebuild docs if the client changed
(`node build-static.js lessons.json docs`), run `node test/run.js`, commit. Be
explicit about what's headless-verified vs needs a live browser/Ollama. The
headless suite lives in `test/` (see `test/README.md`); live-only checks are in
`LIVE-TEST-CHECKLIST.md`.

## Done in this session (do not redo)
**TODO item 2 — store the full user input (`userPrompt`).** Committed.
- Investigation finding: the model was **never** shortchanged. `generate()` sets
  `userTopic = topic` (full) and builds the story prompt from it; only the saved
  *display* `topic` is a short LLM-generated title. Verified against real
  `lessons.json` (`userTopic` full; `storyPrompt` contains it verbatim).
- Change: persist one explicit field `userPrompt` = full topic + any pasted
  story + translation, added to both the early story-save and the final return in
  `generate()` (`server.js` ~1347, ~1467, ~1565). Additive; only `server.js`
  changed (no client/docs rebuild).
- Headless: `test/e2e-userprompt.test.js` (in `test/run.js`) asserts the full
  input is stored in topic mode and story mode, and that `storyPrompt` carries the
  full topic. Suite green.

**Fix — multi-chapter book truncated the topic to 80 chars.** Committed.
- This was the *real* shortening the user saw (the single-chapter path never
  truncated). `/api/generate-book` did `baseTopic = topic.trim().slice(0, 80)`, and
  for a generated batch `baseTopic` is chapter 1's story-prompt theme + the stored
  `userTopic`/`userPrompt` — so a long topic was cut before reaching the model.
- Fix (`server.js` ~2446): keep `baseTopic` full; shorten only the transient
  placeholder label (`baseTopic.slice(0,40)` at the `newBookJob` label and
  `_runBookJob`'s `placeholderTopic`), which the title post-pass overwrites anyway.
- Headless: `test/e2e-booktopic.test.js` (146-char topic) asserts chapter 1's
  `userTopic`/`userPrompt` are full, the display topic stays short, and the model's
  chapter-1 story prompt contains text past char 80.

**TODO item 6 — book gen: source-language storyline summary.** Committed.
- Added step 3 to `_titleStorylinePostPass` (`server.js` ~1898): build chain vocab
  from the chapters' lessons and call the existing
  `generateStorylineSummary(names, stories, vocab, base.srcLang)`, store via
  `upsertStoryline`. Best-effort (try/catch like the title steps).
- Headless: `fake-ollama.js` gained a summary route; `e2e-bookjob.test.js` asserts
  the storyline carries the generated summary.

**TODO item 7 — book gen: auto-QC the finished storyline.** Committed.
- After the title+summary post-pass, `_runBookJob` runs `_runQc` over all chapters
  (`onlyFlagged:false`) on a fresh job id, tagging items chain-wide; transient
  `bj.status = 'qc'`; best-effort.
- Headless: `fake-ollama.js` gained a QC verdict route; `e2e-bookjob.test.js`
  asserts items carry `.qc` tags after the book finishes.
- Note: this adds many translation-model calls per book (intended, per request).
  `bj.status='qc'` is a new transient status the client treats as "still running".

## Triage of the remaining TODO items

Legend: **[H]** headless-doable now · **[L]** needs live Ollama to verify quality ·
**[B]** browser-only to verify · **[XL]** large / multi-session.

| # | Item | Class | Notes |
|---|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | TTS-quality warning + test button + Ecosia link | [B] mostly | logic (voice detection, URL build) is [H]; rendering/speech [B]; "nice voice" heuristic is fuzzy |
| 3 | Lesson editors: keep unsaved edits when deleting a row | [B] | client editor state; needs locating the editor model |
| 4 | Conjugation: only fuse `er/sie/es`, not `ich/wir`, `du/euch` | [H]+[L] | pure-function + prompt; cross-language care needed |
| 5 | Grammar reinforce: normalize injected words to singular noun, reject verbs w/o close noun | [L] | prompt change; quality only verifiable with a real model |
| 6 | Book gen: generate a source-language summary after titles | ✅ DONE | shipped this session (see Done section) |
| 7 | Book gen: run QC on the whole storyline after finishing | ✅ DONE | shipped this session (see Done section) |
| 8 | Cleanup / refactor / dir structure / drop migration code | [XL] | roadmap-only; suggestions below |

Recommended order for the next session (safest → heaviest):
**4 → 5 → 3 → 1 → 8.** (Items 6 and 7 are done. 4 is bounded but needs the
language-aware syncretism map to avoid regressing English; 5 is a prompt change
verifiable only with a real model; 3 needs the editor located; 1 is mostly
browser; 8 is the large refactor.)

---

## Per-item detail & pointers

### 1. TTS-quality warning (below the language selector; live + static) — [B]/[H]
Goal: detect whether a modern (non-robotic) speech-synthesis voice is available;
show a warning styled like the static-version AI warning, with a "Test, 1, 2, 3"
button that speaks in the chosen target language, plus an Ecosia link
`https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=speech+output+with+<browser>+in+<OS>` with
`<browser>`/`<OS>` detected.
- The AI warning to mirror in style: search `index.html` for the static AI-notice
  (shown when no tag filter is used) and copy its markup/placement.
- TTS plumbing already exists: `speakBodyText`, `ttsIsApproximate()`,
  `tts.approx` (search `index.html` for `speechSynthesis` / `ttsApproxBadge`).
  Reuse `ttsIsApproximate()` as the heuristic seed.
- **[H] extractable pure helpers** (unit-testable): `detectBrowser(ua)`,
  `detectOS(ua/platform)`, `buildEcosiaQuery(browser, os)`, and a
  `isLikelyNiceVoice(voices, langPrefix)` predicate (e.g. presence of a non-`localService`
  voice, or a known-good voice name list). Keep heuristics conservative and
  documented — "nice" is inherently fuzzy; prefer "we couldn't detect a high-quality
  voice" wording over false certainty.
- **[B]** actual voice enumeration (`speechSynthesis.getVoices()` is async/lazy),
  the spoken test, and rendering. New strings → `ui.json` `en`.
- Loose end to decide: voice list is empty until `voiceschanged` fires; the warning
  must re-evaluate on that event.

### 3. Lesson editors: preserve unsaved edits on row-delete — [B]
The complaint: deleting one entry in an editor drops other in-progress (unsaved)
edits. Fix = keep edits in an in-memory working buffer; delete mutates the buffer,
not a re-read from stored data; a save is still required to persist.
- TODO(next): locate the editors. Search `index.html` for the vocab/sentence/
  grammar/conjugation edit handlers (the edit UI opened from a lesson). The grep in
  this session for `deleteVocab|removeEntry|_editBuf` found nothing, so the editor
  likely uses different names — start from the edit-open entry point and the Save
  handler, identify the working-copy variable, and make delete operate on it.
- Verification is [B], but if the buffer is a plain array transform it can get a
  small [H] unit test like the pdf-selection helpers.

### 4. Conjugation grouping — only fuse `er/sie/es` — [H]+[L]
Two places fuse pronouns:
- **Prompt** `prompts.json` → `conjugation.system` / `conjugation.user`: instruct
  "GROUP pronouns sharing an identical form … German `er/sie/es` → one entry".
- **Client** `buildConjugationExercises` (`index.html` ~5974, merge loop ~5981–5997):
  merges **any** forms sharing an identical conjugated form. This is the over-fusion:
  in German present tense it also fuses `ihr` with `er/sie/es` (both `geht`) and
  `wir` with `sie`-plural (both `gehen`).
- Subtlety (why this isn't trivially safe): the identical-form merge is **correct
  and desirable for English** (`I/you/we/they → watch`, `he/she/it → watches`).
  Removing it wholesale would make English verbose. Proposed approach: a small
  language-aware "allowed syncretism" map keyed by lesson target lang, e.g.
  `de: only {er, sie, es} may co-group`; `en: {i,you,we,they} and {he,she,it}`;
  unknown langs → trust the model's grouping (don't re-merge). Then the client merge
  only combines pronouns that stay within one allowed cluster.
- **[H]**: `buildConjugationExercises` (or an extracted `mergeConjugationForms`)
  is pure → unit-test the German case (ich/du/wir/ihr stay separate; only er/sie/es
  merge) and the English case (two clusters preserved).
- **[L]**: confirm the prompt change makes qwen emit the canonical paradigm.

### 5. Grammar reinforce: noun-form normalization — [L]
Reinforce injects prior words (verbs, plurals) that don't fit a noun-gender drill,
causing excess fails. Instruct the model (in the grammar/reinforce prompt) to:
(a) reduce each injected word to its base **singular noun** (e.g. `verbesserten`
→ `Verbesserung`); (b) **reject** an injected word if no close noun exists (e.g. a
pure verb with no nominalization). Pointers: `prompts.json` grammar prompt; server
grammar generation around `_gNouns`/`chainVocab` (`server.js` ~1027) and
`generateGrammar`. **[L]** only — quality must be checked with a real model; add a
checklist entry. **TODO (hard, document-only):** German adjectival nouns have
article-dependent gender endings (`ein Begeisterter` vs `der/die Begeisterte`); the
reinforce drill can't reliably present these — consider excluding nominalized
adjectives/participles from gender drills rather than trying to handle them.

### 6. Book gen: source-language summary after titles — ✅ DONE (this session)
Shipped: step 3 of `_titleStorylinePostPass`. Details in the Done section above.
(Original plan, for reference:)
The single-storyline summary already exists:
- `generateStorylineSummary(topics, stories, vocab, srcLang)` (`server.js`:708),
  exposed at `POST /api/storyline-summary` (2703) and stored via
  `sl.summary = …; upsertStoryline(sl)` (2722).
- Add a **step 3** to `_titleStorylinePostPass` (`server.js`:1879, right after the
  storyline title at ~1896, where `sl` is already resolved): collect
  `topics`/`stories`/chain vocab, call `generateStorylineSummary(..., base.srcLang)`,
  set `sl.summary`, `upsertStoryline(sl)`. Best-effort/try-catch like the title steps.
- **[H]** verify with the fake-Ollama harness (add a summary route to the fake):
  after a generated arc book, the storyline has a non-empty `summary`. Extend
  `test/e2e-bookjob.test.js`.

### 7. Book gen: QC the whole storyline after finishing — ✅ DONE (this session)
Shipped: auto-QC step in `_runBookJob` after the post-pass. Details in the Done
section above. (Original plan, for reference:)
The QC the user triggers from the saved list:
- `_runQc(jobId, topics, opts)` (`server.js`:534); `qcCheckPair` (488);
  `POST /api/qc` (2197); client trigger posts to `/api/qc` (`index.html` ~2924).
- At the end of `_runBookJob` (after `_titleStorylinePostPass`), run `_runQc` over
  the chapter topics so the whole storyline is tagged automatically. Decide scope
  (all items vs only-flagged — the manual QC supports `onlyFlagged`; book QC should
  be all items). Run it as its own job id, or inline, and surface progress in the
  book stepper. Best-effort; don't fail the book if QC errors.
- **[H]** with the fake harness: after the book finishes, the chapter lessons carry
  QC tags. (QC is LLM-driven; the fake returns canned pair-checks, so this verifies
  wiring/tagging, not QC quality.)

### 8. Cleanup / refactoring — [XL] (document-only; suggestions)
Concrete candidates observed while working in the code:
- **Split `server.js`** (~2.8k lines) into modules: `llm/` (generate, prompts I/O,
  parsing/repair), `store.js` (load/save/upsert/storylines/chain walking), `qc.js`,
  `book.js` (`_runBookJob` + post-pass), `http.js` (route table). Keep zero-dep.
- **Split `index.html`'s inline script** into source files concatenated at build
  time (the suite already extracts functions by brace-matching, so a real module
  boundary would help). Today everything is one ~350 KB `<script>`.
- **Drop old migration code**: `migrate-v41.js`, `merge-collapsed-forks.js`, and any
  in-`server.js` schema-upgrade branches for pre-v29 stores (search for
  `schemaVersion <`/migration). Gate removal on confirming no users remain on old
  schemas, or move them to a one-shot `tools/` script.
- **De-duplicate the type→emoji/`lesson.type.*` maps**: the
  `{grammar:'🏷️',conjugation:'🔤',…}` + matching key map is repeated ~5×
  (`index.html` ~1260/3460/4853/5310/7004). Extract one `LESSON_TYPE_META` table +
  a `lessonTypeLabel(type)` helper.
- **Unify word-count helpers**: `s.split(/\s+/).filter(Boolean).length` is inlined
  in many places (PDF split/merge, selection, arc). One `wordCount()`.
- **Centralize parent resolution**: the id-first/same-language-guard resolver was
  hand-written at 4 sites in v44 (`_slResolveParent`, `_resolveParentB`,
  `_delResolveParent`, the next-chapter finder). Extract one shared resolver.
- **Directory structure**: move CLI tools (`generate-lessons.js`, `qc-lessons.js`,
  `translate-lessons.js`, `export-lessons.js`, `merge-collapsed-forks.js`,
  `migrate-v41.js`) into `tools/`, docs into `docs-src/` (keep generated `docs/`),
  and the many `*.md`/`*.dot`/`*.svg` design notes into `notes/`.

## Loose ends from my side (Claude)
- **Conjugation (item 4)** I deliberately did **not** implement this session despite
  it being bounded, because a naive fix (restrict the client merge to `er/sie/es`)
  regresses English grouping. It needs the language-aware syncretism map above.
- **`userPrompt` duplication**: for pasted-story mode, `userPrompt` now includes the
  story text, which also lives in `story` (intentional — one self-contained field —
  but it does duplicate large stories in `lessons.json`). If storage matters, switch
  `userPrompt` to topic-only and rely on `story` for the body.
- **Editor location (item 3)** not yet found; my grep used guessed names. Next
  session should start from the lesson edit-open + Save handlers.
- **Test harness** lives in `test/` and is committed. The fake Ollama
  (`test/fake-ollama.js`) now has routes for summary and QC pair-checks (added for
  items 6/7), plus the earlier title/story/vocab routes.
- **Book auto-QC cost & UX (item 7)**: QC now runs automatically after every book,
  adding many translation-model calls per book — fine for a self-hosted setup but
  noticeable on large books. Consider (a) a client toggle to opt out, (b) surfacing
  QC progress in the book stepper (it currently only sets `bj.status='qc'`; the
  per-item `jobStep` goes to a throwaway job id), and (c) limiting auto-QC to
  `onlyFlagged` or to a size cap. Same optionality question applies to the summary
  (item 6) if a user doesn't want it.
- **Live check owed for 6/7**: with a real model, confirm the summary reads well in
  the source language and that auto-QC tags are sensible (the fake only verifies
  wiring/tagging, not QC quality). Add entries to `LIVE-TEST-CHECKLIST.md`.
- **Repo location**: the canonical git repo now lives in the `dreizunge_v44/` folder
  (history carried over from the v43 work). The older `dreizunge_v43_final/`
  directory is stale.
- **Roadmap doc** `roadmap_v44.md` and `roadmap-v43.md` still describe earlier state
  in prose; this file (`roadmap_v45.md`) supersedes them.

## Still owed live verification (unchanged from v44)
See `LIVE-TEST-CHECKLIST.md`: item-4-class conjugation/grammar prompt quality, the
generated-continuation coherence, and all browser-only items (export, storyline
render, arc labels, rating labels, drag-to-highlight). Anything added for items
5/4/1 above will need new checklist entries.
